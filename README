To use the rube loader you should replace the box2d 2.3.0 to 2.3.9.7 
this is how you do  it :
 
1. Download Box2d 2.3.0.7 from the official site, blah-blah-blah, that's obvious.
2. In cocos2d-x/external/Box2D replace all box2d files with the new ones.
3. If you are using Android platform, add 'Dynamics/Joints/b2MotorJoint.cpp \' to LOCAL_SRC_FILES variable in cocos2d-x/external/Box2D/Android.mk.
4. If you are using MSVC, add Dynamics/Joints/b2MotorJoint.cpp and Dynamics/Joints/b2MotorJoint.h to libBox2D project. ( allready did it ) 
5. If you are using GCC 4.3+, add '#include <cstring> to the following headers:
Common/b2GrowableStack.h
Common/b2BlockAllocator.h
This is necessary because GCC 4.3+ stopped including <csrting> and some other standard libs automatically to lower the build time. Don't know why Erin Catto doesn't update his code accordingly to this compiler behaviour.

the Pinball example not respansive to mouse click .. i will work on this latter but you will get the basic idea how to use the loader .
